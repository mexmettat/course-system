Course Registration Management System Project with C++

This was my first ever programming project. The aim of this Project is for students to choose their courses more easily and quickly. They can also preview the courses they will take. There is a program about course management system. Firstly we have a login page that you can register, login and also exit. After you registered and login, you go to the Dashboard. You have four options on the Dashboard. These are see lesson plan, choosing courses, back to login menu and quit. You can choose a year that you want to registered with. Then there will be your courses as elective and compulsory. You should choose these courses and then, you can see your course plan at all.
